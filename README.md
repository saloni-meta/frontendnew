## Development Configuration

### Bypass Authentication

For development and demo purposes, you can bypass the authentication process by setting the `bypassAuth` flag to `true` in the `AuthProtected.tsx` file.

**Warning:** Ensure that you set `bypassAuth` to `false` in production to enable proper authentication.
